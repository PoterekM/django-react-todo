# django-react-todo

## Description
This is a basic todo app to demonstrate CRUD functionality using Django and React

## User Story

* I want to be able to create tasks with a Title, Description, and to mark them as Complete or Incomplete
* I want to see completed and incomplete tasks on my todo list
* I want to be able to edit tasks
* I want to be able to delete tasks

## Development Planning
* Define Todo model in backend
* Create a Django database
* Modify backend with a serializer in order to work with frontend
* Create Viewset to implement CRUD operations
* Create Frontend â€“ initially set static values to ensure complete and incomplete tasks can be viewed
* Remove static information and utilize axios in order to have frontend interact with Django
